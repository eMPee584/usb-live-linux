Definitions used in this https://github.com/fsfw-dresden/usb-live-linux[usb-live-linux] build framework:

- Feature: a distinct functional fragment
- (Build) Variant: assembly of features, yielding in a complete live system image

== Variants can derive from others, inheriting their features

[graphviz, variant-inheritance.png, fdp]
-------
digraph variants {
  splines=curved
  node [ shape = box, style = rounded ];
  edge [ labelfloat = true];
  K=2.5;
  rankdir=LR;
  "Dresden-49-GS-Grundschulstick" -> "FSFW-Schulstick" [ xlabel = "based on" ];
  "FSFW-Uni-Stick-TU-Dresden_Xfce" -> "FSFW-Uni-Stick_Xfce" [ xlabel = "based on" ];
}
-------

== Which features are enabled in the various stick variants?

-  : feature is not included in this variant
- ✔: feature is enabled in this variant
- ✔!: feature is only in this variant
- ✘: feature is disabled in this variant
