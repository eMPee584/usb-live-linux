# Stick Build Variants
This directory contains the recipe for each of the FSFW usb-live-linux stick build variants. It contains config files to define fundamental aspects of the build, as for example target architecture (64 or 32 bit) or [Debian Release](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases), as well as symbolic links to (or local specifications of) the features included in this variants.

# Variants / Features Table
Because github serves HTML with a content-type of text/plain, to view the table, use the following GitCDN link or view the features.html in your locally checked out copy of this repository. (Side-story: another solution to this would be to embed the HTML in an SVG foreignObject tag, but that is an even hackier approach, so we dropped that after wasting a lot of time on it.)
