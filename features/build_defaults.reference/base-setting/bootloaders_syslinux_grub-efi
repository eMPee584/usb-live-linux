#        --bootloaders grub-legacy|grub-pc|syslinux|grub-efi|"BOOTLOADERS"
#            defines which bootloaders to use in the  generated  image.  This
#            only  has  an  effect if the selected binary image type lets you
#            choose the bootloader. For example, if you  build  an  ISO  then
#            syslinux  (or  more precise, isolinux) is always used. Also note
#            that not all combinations of binary image types and  bootloaders
#            are supported (lb config will fail to create such an unsupported
#            configuration and will give a explanation about it). For HDD im‐
#            ages  on  amd64 and i386, the default is 'syslinux'. This option
#            supports more than one bootloader  to  be  specified  (space  or
#            comma  separated)  in order to allow for both BIOS and EFI boot‐
#            loaders to be included, though note that only one of  each  type
#            can be used (i.e. do not try to use two BIOS bootloaders).

# (!) since 2016 (f811656150ff5f78e55b21702688f082330f78bd), live-build
# defaults to "syslinux,grub-efi" on amd64 and i386
# see /usr/share/live/build/functions/configuration.sh
