#        --cache-packages true|false
#            defines  if  downloaded  packages files should be cached which is
#            true by default. Disabling it does save space consumption in your
#            build  directory,  but remember that you will cause much unneces‚Äê
#            sary traffic if you do a  couple  of  rebuilds.  In  general  you
#            should  always  leave  it  true, however, in some particular rare
#            build setups, it can be faster to refetch packages from the local
#            network mirror rather than to utilize the local disk.
