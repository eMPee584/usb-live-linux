#        --firmware-chroot true|false
#            includes  firmware packages in the live image. Defaults to true.
#            Beware that some firmware packages are non-free and will only be
#            included  if  the  non-free  archive  area  is included in --ar‚Äê
#            chive-areas (and --parent-archive-areas). This  is  particularly
#            relevant if you want working wifi for instance.
