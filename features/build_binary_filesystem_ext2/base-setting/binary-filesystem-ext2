#            defines the filesystem to be used in the image type.  This  only
#            has  an effect if the selected binary image type lets you choose
#            a filesystem. For example, for the ISO image type the  resulting
#            CD/DVD  always has the filesystem ISO9660. When building HDD im‚Äê
#            ages for USB sticks, multiple filesystem formats are  supported,
#            thus  this  becomes  applicable to allow selection. Note that it
#            defaults to 'fat32' on all architectures. Also note that if  you
#            choose  'fat16' and your resulting binary image gets bigger than
#            2GB,  the  binary  filesystem  automatically  gets  switched  to
#            'fat32'.
