#     The new option --uefi-secure-boot can be set to auto (default,
#     enable or disable.
#     In auto, the lack of the signed EFI binaries is intentionally left as a
#     soft failure - live-build will simply fallback to using the locally
#     generated non-signed grub2 monolithic EFI binary as the only
#     bootloader. [â€¦]
#     The enable or disable options work as expected.
