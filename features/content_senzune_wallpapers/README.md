> My fractal artworks have been removed from DeviantArt.

> They remain accessible for personal non-commercial non-AI use here:

> 
> The reason is that DeviantArt recently decided to support Artificial
> Intelligence (AI) algorithms used to generate images based on existing artworks
> without permission from the original artists. I am principally opposed to AI
> 'art' and can no longer support this site.
