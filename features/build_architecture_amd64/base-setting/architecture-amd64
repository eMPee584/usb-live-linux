#        -a|--architectures ARCHITECTURE
#            defines the architecture of the to be build  image.  By  default,
#            this is set to the host architecture. Note that you cannot cross‐
#            build for another architecture if your host system is not able to
#            execute  binaries for the target architecture natively. For exam‐
#            ple, building amd64 images on i386 and vice versa is possible  if
#            you have a 64bit capable i386 processor and the right kernel. But
#            building powerpc images on an i386 system is not possible.
