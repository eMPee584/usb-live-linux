# This file is used to configure htpdate daemon. Most users needn't change
# anything here.

# htpdate will run on system boot as daemon and at every network restart
# (IF UP). However you can disable each one uncommenting the following lines.
# But IF YOUR SYSTEM ARE USING SYSTEMD (Debian Jessie and newer use it!),
# the first line will be ignored. You can use '# systemctl disable htpdate'
# to disable htpdate on boot and '# systemctl enable htpdate' to reenable it.
# HTP_DAEMON=no
# HTP_IFUP=no

# If you have a HTTP proxy, uncomment the following line and change the
# values.
# HTP_PROXY="-P myproxy-xyz.com:8080"

# In the next line you should put HTTP servers. Note that htpdate uses
# the timestamps extracted from headers to synchronize the time. You
# must to use reliable servers only. Remember: you can use any site, not
# specifics NTP site only.
HTP_SERVERS="debian.org kernel.org 1.1.1.1"

# The general options can be viewed with '$ htpdate -h'. However, you can
# keep the current options, that works fine.
HTP_OPTIONS="-D -s -p1"
