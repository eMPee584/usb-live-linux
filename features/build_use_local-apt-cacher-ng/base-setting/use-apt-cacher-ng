#        --cache-packages true|false
#            defines  if  downloaded packages files should be cached. This is
#            true by default. Disabling it does  save  space  consumption  in
#            your  build directory, but remember that you will cause much un‐
#            necessary traffic if you do a couple of rebuilds. In general you
#            should  always  leave  it true, however, in some particular rare
#            build setups, it can be faster to refetch packages from the net‐
#            work  mirror,  if  using a local one, rather than to utilize the
#            local disk.

#        --apt-http-proxy URL
#            sets  the  HTTP  proxy  to  be  used by apt. By default, this is
#            empty. Note that this variable is only for the proxy  that  gets
#            used  by  apt  internally  within the chroot, it is not used for
#            anything else.

#        --mirror-bootstrap URL
#            sets the location of the debian package mirror  that  should  be
#            used   to  bootstrap  the  derivative  from.  This  defaults  to
#            'http://deb.debian.org/debian/'.

#        -m|--parent-mirror-bootstrap URL
#            sets the location of the debian package mirror  that  should  be
#            used  to  bootstrap  from.  This defaults to the value of --mir‐
#            ror-bootstrap.
