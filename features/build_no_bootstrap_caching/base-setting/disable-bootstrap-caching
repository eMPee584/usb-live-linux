#        --cache-stages STAGE|"STAGES"
#            sets which stages should be cached (a comma or space
#            separated list). By default this is  set  to  'boot‐
#            strap'.  As  an exception to the normal stage names,
#            'rootfs' can also be  used  here  which  means  only
#            cache  the  generated  root  filesystem  in filesys‐
#            tem.{dir,ext*,squashfs}. This is useful  during  de‐
#            velopment  if  you  want to rebuild the binary stage
#            but not regenerate the root filesystem all the time.
